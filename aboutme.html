      Hey hope you are doing well ! <br><br>

      My name is Vineeth and I am an aspiring Software Engineer by profession and a developer who loves to code. I love problem-solving, making use of efficient data structures and algorithms, writing clean, modular, and understandable code, packed with detailed comments and explanations. <br>
      I have practiced and brainstormed a plethora of problem-solving questions on various platforms like LeetCode, GeeksForGeeks, InterviewBit, Pepcoding, and Codechef. I am proficient in C++ and Python and use C++ as my primary programming language for coding. I have a sound grasp of core computer fundamentals, I take pride in being my "University Topper" with 3x 10/10 perfect SGPA. <br>
      I am an active member of LeetCode discussions and love to share my neatly commented codes in the forums. I also write technical blogs to share my knowledge on solving a problem with different perspectives. I have neatly documented and stored my code collections on GitHub. <br>
      I have worked out various scenarios and made extensive use of C++ STL Libraries to solve challenging problems. <br>
      My day starts and ends with prioritizing various tasks to be performed, ensuring I make full use of my time. I love to work out everything will full dedication and focus. I am passionate about keeping myself occupied and always plan out my work schedule one day prior. I have been using various productivity apps like "Trello", "T0-Do", "Notion", etc past 2 years. <br>
      It would be my honor to work with Amazon. Looking forward to a great learning experience with you. <br>
